## What is Docker? 

Applications are often developed and tested on one machine. This leads to a problem more commonly known as "works on my machine" where the developer does not know why or how the application does not work on a different machine. In addition, different parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not working. These changes may be anything from an operating system update to changes in dependencies, or even hardware changes.

Docker combines the application and its dependencies into an **image** that can then be run on any machine, provided it can run Docker.

Isn't there already a solution for this? Virtual Machines are not the same as the Docker Engine and they solve different problems. We will not be looking into Virtual Machines on this course.

### Image vs container

Containers are instances of images.

Cooking metaphor:
Dockerfile is the shopping list.
Image is the ingredients (& recipe).
Container is the delicious treat.

## Hello World docker 

This is a small exercise that will run through the basics. Do not worry about the commands too much yet.  

Pay attention to the time it takes to complete the command and run `docker run hello-world` 

This command outputs the following: 

```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
d1725b59e92d: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:0add3ace90ecb4adbf7777e9aacf18357296e799f81cabc9fde470971e499788
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
--application output--
```

The command checks if you already have the image 'hello-world', connects to Docker Hub, pulls the 'hello-world' image and runs it, creating a container.  

Congratulations, you've now ran your first dockerized application. Let's get used to the commands before going forward.

## Docker CLI basics

The Docker CLI is usually referenced as the "docker engine", see [docs for more information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)

Even though you will find over 50 commands in the documentation, for general usage we are only going to need handful of commands. You'll find a list of most commonly used basic commands at the end of this section.

To list images you currently have downloaded, run: `docker images` 

As you can see, the *hello-world* we recently ran is still lingering in the images. Let's run it a couple more times: 

`docker run hello-world`  

As we already had previously downloaded *hello-world*, Docker noticed that you already have the image and ran it straight away. Look at the list of images again. It should reveal that there is still only one *hello-world* image.

Let's remove the image since we don't need it anymore. The command `docker rmi hello-world` can be used to remove the *hello-world* image. However, this should fail with the following error: 

      Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "hello-world" (must force) - container <container ID> is using its referenced image <image ID>

This means that a container currently exists which was created from the image *hello-world* and that removing *hello-world* could have consequences. So before removing images, you should have the referencing container removed first. Forcing is usually a bad idea, especially as we are still learning.

To list containers that are running, run: `docker ps` 

Since *hello-world* has already exited, it is not listed. Run `docker ps -a` to list all containers.

Notice that containers have a *container ID* and *name*. The name is autogenerated to be something like "objective_austin".

When we have a lot of different containers, we can use grep (or another similar utility) to filter the list:

`docker ps -a | grep hello-world` 

Let's remove the container with the `rm` command. It accepts a container's name or ID as its arguments. Notice that the command also works with the first few characters of an ID. For example, if a container's ID is 3d4bab29dd67, you can use `docker rm 3d` to delete it. Using the shorthand for the ID will not delete multiple containers, so if you have two IDs starting with 3d, a warning will be printed and neither will be deleted. You can also use multiple arguments: `docker rm id1 id2 id3`

If you have hundreds of stopped containers and you wish to delete them all you should use `docker container prune` 
 
> TIP: prune was introduced in 1.13 and in previous versions you can use `docker rm $(docker ps -q -f status=exited)` where -q prints just container ids and -f filters the list of containers to only those where status is exited 

After removing all of the *hello-world* containers, run `docker rmi hello-world` to delete the image. You can use `docker images` to confirm that the image is not listed. 

You can also use `pull` command to download images without running them: `docker pull hello-world`

Let's try starting a new container:

`docker run nginx`

Notice how the command line appears to freeze after pulling and starting the container. This is because nginx is now running in the current terminal, blocking the input. Let's exit by pressing `control + c` and try again with the `-d` flag.

`docker run -d nginx`

The `-d` flag starts a container *detached*, meaning that it runs in the background. The container can be seen with `docker ps`

Now if we try to remove it, it will fail: 

`docker rm <container id or name>` 

      Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container f72c583c982ca686b0826fdc447f04710e78ff6c25dc1ddc7c427cc35eadf5f0. Stop the container before attempting removal or force remove 

 
We should first stop the container using `docker stop <container id or name>` and then use `rm`.

Forcing is also a possibility and we can this time safely use `docker rm --force <container id or name>`.

It's common that, over time, the docker daemon becomes clogged with old images and containers.
 

### MOST USED COMMANDS 

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `docker ps -a` | Lists all containers | 
| `docker images` | Lists all images |
| `docker pull <image>` | Pulls image from a docker registry called docker hub |
| `docker rm <container-id>` | Removes a container, you can use either container name or id |
| `docker rmi <image-id>` | Removes an image, you can use either image name or id |
| `docker stop <container-id>` | Stops a container, you can use either container name or id |
| `docker run <image>` | Runs an image creating a container, you can use either image name or id | 


Do exercises 1.1 and 1.2

### Where do the images come from?

When running a command such as `docker run hello-world`, Docker will automatically search [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for the image if it is not found locally.

This means that we can pull and run any public image from Docker's servers. For example‚ if we wanted to start an instance of the PostgreSQL database, we could just run `docker run postgres` which would pull and run https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/.

We can search for images in the Docker Hub with `docker search`. Try running `docker search hello-world`.

The search finds plenty of results, and prints each image's name, short description, amount of stars, and "official" and "automated" status.

    NAME                         DESCRIPTION    STARS   OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED
    hello-world                  Hello World!…  699     [OK]
    kitematic/hello-world-nginx  A light-weig…  112
    tutum/hello-world            Image to tes…  56                 [OK]
    ...

Let's examine the list.

The first result, `hello-world`, is an official image. [Official images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) are curated by Docker and are usually actively maintained by the authors. They are built from repositories in the [docker-library](https://github.com/docker-library).

When browsing the CLI's search results, you can recognize an official image from the "[OK]" in the "OFFICIAL" column and from the fact that the image's name has no prefix (aka organization/user). When browsing Docker Hub, the page will say "official repository" instead of "public repository". For example, see the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/) of the `hello-world` image.

The third result, `tutum/hello-world`, is marked as "automated". This means that the image is [automatically built](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) from the source repository. Its [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/tutum/hello-world/) shows its "Build Details" and a link to the image's "Source Repository" (in this case, to Github) from which Docker Hub builds the image.

The second result, `kitematic/hello-world-nginx`, is neither an official nor automated image.
We can't really know what the image is built from, since its [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/kitematic/hello-world-nginx/) has no links to any repos. The only thing its Docker Hub page reveals is that the image is 3 years old. Even if the image's "Full Description" had links to a repository, we would have no guarantees that the published image was actually built from that source.

There are also other Docker registries competing with Docker Hub, such as [quay](https://quay.io/). However, `docker search` will only search Docker Hub, so we'll need to use the registry's web pages to search for images. Take a look at the page of [the `nordstrom/hello-world` image on guay](https://quay.io/repository/nordstrom/hello-world). The page shows the command to use to pull the image, which reveals that we can also pull images from other hosts than Docker Hub:

`docker pull quay.io/nordstrom/hello-world`

So by default, if the host (here: `quay.io`) is omitted, it will pull from Docker Hub.

## A detailed look into an image

Let's move on to something more relevant than 'hello-world', for example to [Ubuntu from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/ubuntu/). It is one of the most common Docker images to use as a base for your own image. 

Anyway, let's pull Ubuntu! `docker pull ubuntu`

Let's look at the first lines:

      Using default tag: latest
      latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu

Since we didn't specify a tag, Docker defaulted to `latest` which is usually the latest image built and pushed to the registry. **However**, in this case the repository's README says that the `ubuntu:latest` tag points to the "latest LTS" instead, since that's the version recommended for general use.

Images can be tagged to save different versions of the same image. You define an image's tag by adding `:<tag>` after the image's name.

Ubuntu's [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/ubuntu/tags/) reveals that there's a tag named 16.04 which promises us that the image is based on Ubuntu 16.04. Let's pull that as well:

    $ docker pull ubuntu:16.04 

      16.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu 
      c2ca09a1934b: Downloading [============================================>      ]  34.25MB/38.64MB 
      d6c3619d2153: Download complete 
      0efe07335a04: Download complete 
      6b1bb01b3a3b: Download complete 
      43a98c187399: Download complete 

Images are composed of different layers that are downloaded in parallel to speed up the download.

We can also tag images locally for convenience, for example `docker tag ubuntu:16.04 ubuntu:xenial` creates the tag `ubuntu:xenial` which refers to `ubuntu:16.04`.

Tagging is also a way to "rename" images. Run `docker tag ubuntu:16.04 fav_distro:xenial` and check `docker images` to see what effects the command had.

We can now create a new Ubuntu container and execute the `uptime` command by running `docker run fav_distro:xenial uptime`

> Mac/win only: Notice how the uptime is the uptime of your moby virtual machine. 

We'll look more into the Ubuntu image in part 3.

### Running and stopping containers 

Let's run a container in the background

`docker run -d --name looper ubuntu:16.04 sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'`

- First part `docker run -d` should be familiar by now.

- Because we started the ran the container with `--name looper` we can now reference it easily.

- The image is `ubuntu:16.04` and the last part is the given to the container.

And check that it's running with `docker ps`

Lets follow '-f' the output of logs with `docker logs -f looper`

      Fri Oct 19 11:51:05 UTC 2018
      Fri Oct 19 11:51:06 UTC 2018
      Fri Oct 19 11:51:07 UTC 2018
      ... 

Lets test pausing the looper without exiting or stopping. In another terminal run `docker pause looper`. Notice how the logs output has paused in the first terminal. To unpause do `docker unpause looper`.

Keep the logs open and attach to the container on the second terminal using 'attach': 

    $ docker attach looper 
      Mon Jan 15 19:26:54 UTC 2018 
      Mon Jan 15 19:26:55 UTC 2018 
      ... 

Now you have logs (STDOUT) running in two terminals. Now in the attach window press control+c. The container is stopped because the process is no longer running.

If we want to attach to a container and make sure we don't close it we can disable signal proxying. Lets start the stopped container with `docker start looper` and attach to it with `--sig-proxy=false`. 

Then try control+c.  

    $ docker start looper 

    $ docker attach --sig-proxy=false looper 
      Mon Jan 15 19:27:54 UTC 2018 
      Mon Jan 15 19:27:55 UTC 2018 
      ^C 

The container will stays running, just disconnecting you from the STDOUT. 

To enter a container, we can start a new process in it.

    $ docker exec -it looper bash 

      root@2a49df3ba735:/# ps aux 

      USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND 
      root         1  0.0  0.0   4496  1716 ?        Ss   10:31   0:00 sh -c while true; do date; sleep 1; done 
      root       271  0.0  0.0   4496   704 ?        Ss   10:33   0:00 sh 
      root       300  0.0  0.0  18380  3364 pts/0    Ss   10:33   0:00 bash 
      root       386  0.0  0.0   4368   672 ?        S    10:33   0:00 sleep 1 
      root       387  0.0  0.0  36836  2900 pts/0    R+   10:34   0:00 ps aux 

In our command `-it` is short for `-i`  and `-t` where `-i` is "interactive, connect STDIN" and `-t` "allocate a pseudo-TTY". From `ps aux` listing we can see that our `bash` process got pid 300. 

Now that we're inside the container it behaves like you'd expect from ubuntu and we can terminate the container by killing the process with `kill 1` or exit the container with `exit` and either kill or stop the container. 

Our looper won't stop for SIGTERM that the stop sends but stop sends SIGKILL command after grace period. In this case it's simply faster to use kill.

    $ docker kill looper 
    $ docker rm looper 

The previous two commands would be basically the same as `docker rm --force looper` 

Let's start another process with `-it` and also with `--rm` to remove it automatically after it has exited. This means that there is no garbage containers left behind, but also that `docker start` can not be used to start the container after it has exited. 

`docker run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu:16.04 sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'`

Now let's attach to the container and hit control+p, control+q that detaches us from the STDOUT.

    $ docker attach looper-it 

      Mon Jan 15 19:50:42 UTC 2018 
      Mon Jan 15 19:50:43 UTC 2018 
      ^P^Qread escape sequence 

Note that hitting `^C` would still kill (and remove due to `--rm`) the process because the `docker attach` was done without `--sig-proxy=false` 

Do exercise 1.3

## Creating your own dockerized project 

Create a folder and a file called Dockerfile inside it with the following content: 


``` 
FROM ubuntu:16.04 

WORKDIR /mydir 
RUN touch hello.txt 
COPY local.txt . 
RUN wget http://example.com/index.html 
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
``` 

 - `WORKDIR` will create **and** set the current working directory to `/mydir` after this directive 

 - `RUN` will execute a command with `/bin/sh -c` prefix - Because of `WORKDIR` this is essentially same as `RUN touch /mydir/hello.txt` 

 - `COPY` adds a local file to the second argument. It's preferred to use `COPY` instead of `ADD` when you are just adding files (ADD has all kinds of magic behaviour attached to it) 

Then we'll build it by running build with context argument `.` which means that we have to be in the same directory (we could run this build from another directory and then give the path here) 

    $ docker build . 

 

This fails in the `COPY` because the `local.txt` doesn't exist. Fix that and build again to see the next error. 

Before fixing the next error now notice how all steps that modify the image will say ` ---> Using cache` - this is because the Docker daemon caches all the operations for speed. Changing any build directive will invalidate all the caches **after** that line. 

Now we will find out that `wget` doesn't exist in the Ubuntu base image.  We'll need to add it with `apt-get` as this is Ubuntu. But, if we just add: 

    RUN apt-get install -y wget  

It will fail because the apt sources are not part of the image to bring down the size (and they would be old anyway). When we add lines 

    RUN apt-get update 
    RUN apt-get install -y wget 


the image should build nicely and at the end it will say something like `Successfully built 66b527252f32` where the `66b527252f32` is a random name for our **image**. 

Before running our image we have a looming problem ahead of us: because `apt-get update` is run in a separate step that is cached. If we add another package in the `apt-get install -y` line some other day, the sources might have changed and thus the installing will fail. When something depends on another command, it's best practise to run them together, like this: 

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget 

We don't have to give a command (to be run in the container) after the image since the ubuntu base image sets it to `bash` at the last line.

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04 

WORKDIR /mydir 
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget 

RUN touch hello.txt 
COPY local.txt . 
RUN wget http://example.com/index.html 
```

The random name for our image is also not ideal, because now we need to separately `docker tag 66b527252f32 myfirst` to have a sensible name for it, so let's build it again to also tag it: 

    $ docker build -t myfirst . 

Now let's run our image.

    $ docker run -it myfirst 
      root@accf99660aeb:/mydir# ls 
      hello.txt  index.html  local.txt 

Our `WORKDIR` was last set to `/mydir` so our inherited `bash` command is started in that directory.  Also note how our hostname `accf99660aeb` equals the container id.  Before exiting the container, let's create one file (in addition to the files created by our `Dockerfile`) 

    $ touch manually.txt 
    $ exit 

Now we can use diff to compare changes between our image `myfirst` and container: 

    $ docker diff accf

      C /mydir 
      A /mydir/manually.txt 
      C /root 
      A /root/.bash_history 

What we discover is that in addition to our `manually.txt` file, `bash` "secretly" created a history file.  We could create a new image from these changes (`myfirst` + **changes** = **newimage**) with  

    $ docker commit accf99660aeb myfirst-pluschanges 

Let's try creating a new container from the new image, this time by setting the command to "ls -l". Also notice how we don't have to allocate pseudo-TTY or connect STDIN since our command is not interactive (and will exit anyway immediately) 

    $ docker run myfirst-pluschanges ls -l 
      total 4 
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Jan  5 11:59 hello.txt 
      -rw------- 1 root root 1270 Aug  9  2013 index.html 
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Jan  5 12:18 manually.txt 

And as expected, our `manually.txt` file is now in the image.  

### Bigger and more complex image

Now let's start moving towards a more meaningful image. `youtube-dl` a program that downloads youtube videos <https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html> Let's add it to the image - but this time instead of doing it directly in `Dockerfile`, let's try another approach that is sometimes easier than our current process where we add things to it and try to see if it builds. This time we'll open up an interactive session and test stuff beforehand "storing" it in our Dockerfile. By following the youtube-dl install instructions blindly we'll see that... 

    $ docker run -it myfirst 
      root@8c587232a608:/mydir# sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 
      bash: sudo: command not found 
 
..`sudo` is not installed, but since we are `root` we don't need it now, so let's try again without... 

    root@8c587232a608:/mydir# curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 
    bash: curl: command not found 

..and we see that curl is not installed either - we could just revert to use `wget`, but as an exercise, let's add `curl` with `apt-get` since we already have the apt sources in our image (that hopefully are still valid) 


    $ apt-get install -y curl 
    $ curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 

Then we'll add permissions and run it: 

    $ chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 
    $ youtube-dl
      /usr/bin/env: 'python': No such file or directory 

Okay - On the top of the `youtube-dl` download page we'll notice that 

> Remember youtube-dl requires Python version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+ to work except for Windows exe. 

So let's add python 

    $ apt-get install -y python 

And let's run it again 

    $ youtube-dl 

      WARNING: Assuming --restrict-filenames since file system encoding cannot encode all characters. Set the LC_ALL environment variable to fix this. 
      Usage: youtube-dl [OPTIONS] URL [URL...] 

      youtube-dl: error: You must provide at least one URL. 
      Type youtube-dl --help to see a list of all options. 
 

It works (we just need to give an URL), but we notice that it outputs a warning about `LC_ALL`. In a regular Ubuntu desktop/server install the localization settings are (usually) set, but in this image they are not set, as we can see by running `env` in our container. To fix this without installing additional locales, see this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/41648500 

    $ LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 youtube-dl 

And it works! Let's persist it for our session and try downloading a video: 

    $ export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 
    $ youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLCdmfGs7E 

So now when we know what do, let's add these to the bottom of our `Dockerfile` - by adding the instructions to the bottom we preserve our cached layers - this is handy practise to speed up creating the initial version of a Dockerfile when it has time consuming operations like downloads. 

    ... 

    RUN apt-get install -y curl python 

    RUN curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 

    RUN chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl 

    ENV LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 

    CMD ["/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl"] 

- Instead of using `RUN export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8` we'll store the env directly in the image 

- We'll also override `bash` as our image command (set on the base image) with `youtube-dl` itself. This won't work, but let's see why. 

When we build this as `youtube-dl` 

    $ docker build -t youtube-dl . 

And run it: 

    $ docker run youtube-dl 

      Usage: youtube-dl [OPTIONS] URL [URL...] 

      youtube-dl: error: You must provide at least one URL. 

      Type youtube-dl --help to see a list of all options. 


So far so good, but now the natural way to use this image would be to give the URL as an argument: 

    $ docker run youtube-dl http://www.youtube.com 

      /usr/local/bin/docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:296: starting container process caused "exec: \"http://www.youtube.com\": stat http://www.youtube.com: no such file or directory": unknown. 

      ERRO[0001] error waiting for container: context canceled 

Now our URL became the command (`CMD`). Luckily we have another way to do this: we can use `ENTRYPOINT` to define the main executable and then docker will combine our run arguments for it. 

    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl"] 

And now it works like it should: 

    $ docker build -t youtube-dl . 

    $ docker run youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=UFLCdmfGs7E 

      [youtube] UFLCdmfGs7E: Downloading webpage 
      [youtube] UFLCdmfGs7E: Downloading video info webpage

      [download] 100% of 3.02MiB in 00:0072MiB/s ETA 00:003 

Now there's one more thing in `ENTRYPOINT` vs `CMD` that might be confusing - there are two ways to set them: **exec** form and **shell** form. We've been using the exec form where the command itself is executed. In shell form the command that is executed is wrapped with `/bin/sh -c` - it's useful when you need to evaluate environment variables in the command like `$MYSQL_PASSWORD` or similar. 

In the shell form the command is provided as a string without brackets. In the exec form the command and it's arguments are provided as a list (with brackets), see the table below: 


|Dockerfile | Resulting command|
|---|---|

Now we have two problems: 

- Minor: Our container build process creates many layers resulting in increased image size 

- Major: The downloaded files stay in the container 

Let's fix the major issue first. We'll look at the minor issue in part 3.

By inspecting `docker ps -a` we can see all our previous runs. When we filter this list with 

    $ docker ps -a --last 3 

      CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                   CREATED                  STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES 

    be9fdbcafb23        youtube-dl          "/usr/local/bin/yout…"    Less than a second ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       determined_elion 

    b61e4029f997        f2210c2591a1        "/bin/sh -c \"/usr/lo…"   Less than a second ago   Exited (2) About a minute ago                       vigorous_bardeen 

    326bb4f5af1e        f2210c2591a1        "/bin/sh -c \"/usr/lo…"   About a minute ago       Exited (2) 3 minutes ago                            hardcore_carson 

 
We'll see that the last container was `be9fdbcafb23` or `determined_elion` for us humans. 

    $ docker diff determined_elion 

      C /mydir 
      A /mydir/Short introduction to Docker (Scribe)-UFLCdmfGs7E.mp4 

Let's try `docker cp` command to copy the file (notice the quotes because of our filename that has spaces) 

    $ docker cp "determined_elion://mydir/Short introduction to Docker (Scribe)-UFLCdmfGs7E.mp4" . 

And now we have our file locally. This doesn't really fix our issue, so let's continue: 

### Volumes: bind mount 

By **bind mounting** a host (our machine) folder to the container we can get the file directly to our machine. Let's start another run with `-v` option, that requires an absolute path. We mount our current folder as `/mydir` in our container, overwriting everything that we have put in that folder in our Dockerfile. 

    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/mydir youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=UFLCdmfGs7E 

> Note: the Docker for Mac/Win has some magic so that the directories from our host become available for the `moby` virtual machine allowing our command to work as it would on a Linux machine. 

### Allowing external connections into containers

The details on how programs communicate are not detailed in this course. Courses on Operating Systems and Networking courses explain these. On this course you only need to know the following simplified basics:
- Sending messages: Programs can send messages to [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) addresses such as this: http://127.0.0.1:3000 where http is the [_protocol_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), 127.0.0.1 is a ip address, and and 3000 is a [_port_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)). Note the ip part could also be a [_hostname_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname): 127.0.0.1 is always also named [_localhost_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost) so instead you could use http://localhost:3000.
- Receiving messages: Programs can be assigned to listen to any available port. If a program is listening for traffic on port 3000 and a message is sent to that port it will receive it (and depending on the message process it).

Opening a connection from outside world to a docker container happens in two steps: 

- Exposing port

- Publishing port

Exposing a container port means that you tell Docker that the container listens to a certain port.

Publishing a port means that Docker will map containers ports to host (your machine) ports.

To expose a port, add line `EXPOSE <port>` in your Dockerfile

To publish a port, run the container with `-p <host-port>:<container-port>`

For example: A certain application uses port 1234 to accept udp connections.

`EXPOSE 1234` in the Dockerfile will allow container created from the image to accept connections.
Lets say that the image name is "app-in-port"

- `docker run -p 1234:4567 app-in-port`

Now you could make connection to host port 4567 and it will be mapped to the application port.

You can also limit connections to certain protocol only, in this case udp by adding the protocol at the end: `EXPOSE 1234/udp` and `-p 1234:4567/udp` respectively.

Do exercises 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6

### Publishing projects in Docker Hub

Go to <https://hub.docker.com/> to create an account. You can configure docker hub to build your images for you, but using `push` works as well.

Lets publish the youtube-dl image. Log in and navigate to your [dashboard](https://hub.docker.com/) and press Create Repository. The namespace can be either your personal account or an organization account. For now lets stick to personal accounts and write something descriptive such as youtube-dl to repository name. We'll need to remember it in part 2.

Set visibility to public. Free accounts have access to 1 free private repository.

> In the past organization accounts had 0 free private repositories and accounts can be converted into organization accounts. This would lead to 1/0 private repositories for organization accounts if account had private repository before conversion.

Next we need to rename the image:

`docker tag youtube-dl <username>/<repositoryname>`

And the last thing we need is to authenticate our push by logging in:

`docker login`

Pushing should now work without problems:

`docker push <username>/<repositoryname>`

Do exercises 1.7 and 1.8
