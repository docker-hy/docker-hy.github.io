  A good developer creates well written READMEs that can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease.

  Clone, fork or download the project from
  [https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend).

  Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-frontend) and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 5000
  exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
  you will see message if you're successful.

  Submit the Dockerfile.

  *As in other exercises, do not alter the code of the project*

  > TIP: The project has install instructions in README.

  > TIP: Note that the app starts to accept connections when "Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000" has been
  printed to the screen, this takes a few seconds

  > TIP: You do not have to install anything new outside containers.
