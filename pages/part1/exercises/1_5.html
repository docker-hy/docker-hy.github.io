<div class="exercise" markdown="1">

  <h1>1.5</h1>

  Start a ubuntu image with the process `sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1;
    curl http://$website;'`

  You will notice that a few things required for proper execution are missing. Be sure to remind yourself which flags
    to use so that the read actually waits for input.

  > Note also that curl is NOT installed in the container yet. You will have to install it from inside of the container.

  Test inputting `helsinki.fi` into the application. It should respond with something like

  ```html
<html>

<head>
  <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
  <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">here</a>.</p>
</body>

</html>
  ```

  This time return the command you used to start process and the command(s) you used to fix the ensuing problems.

  > This exercise has multiple solutions, if the curl for helsinki.fi works then it's done. Can you figure out other
  (smart) solutions?
