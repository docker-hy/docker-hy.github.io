  <h1>1.5 Sizes of images</h1>

  In a previous exercise we used `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu`. 
  
  Here is the same application but instead of ubuntu is using alpine: `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine`. 

  Pull both images and compare the image sizes.
  Go inside the alpine container and make sure the secret message functionality is the same. Alpine version doesn't have bash but it has sh.
