  <h1>1.1 Getting started</h1>

  Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.

  Start 3 containers from image that does not automatically exit, such as nginx, detached.

  Stop 2 of the containers leaving 1 up.

  Submitting the output for docker container ls -a is enough to prove this exercise has been done.
