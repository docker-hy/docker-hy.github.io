  <h1>1.3: Secret message</h1>

  Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

  Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` will start a container that outputs logs into a file. 
  Go inside the container and use `tail -f ./text.log` to follow the logs. 
  Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

  Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
