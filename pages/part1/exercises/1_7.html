  <h1>1.7</h1>

  Now that we know how to create and build Dockerfiles we can improve previous works.

  Create a Dockerfile for a new image that starts from ubuntu:16.04.

  Make a script file on you local machine with such content as `echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;`. Transfer this file to an image and
  run it inside the container using CMD. Build the image with tag "curler".

  Run command `docker container run [options] curler` (with correct flags again, as in 1.5) and input helsinki.fi into it. Output
  should match the 1.5 one.

  Return both Dockerfile(s) and the command you used to run the container(s)
