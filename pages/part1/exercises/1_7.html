  <h1>1.7: Two line Dockerfile </h1>

  By default our `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine` doesn't have a CMD. It instead uses *ENTRYPOINT* to declare which application is run.

  We'll talk more about *ENTRYPOINT* in the next section, but you already know that the last argument in `docker run` can be used to give command.

  As you might've noticed it doesn't start the web service even though the name is "simple-web-service". A command is needed to start the server!

  Try `docker run devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine hello`. The application reads the argument but will inform that hello isn't accepted.

  In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create a brand new image that automatically runs the server. 
  Tag the new image as "web-server"

  Return the Dockerfile and the command you used to run the container.

  Running the built "web-server" image should look like this:
  ```console
$ docker run web-server
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:   export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:  gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /*path                    --> server.Start.func1 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
  ```

  > We don't have any method of accessing the web service yet. As such confirming that the console output is the same will suffice.
