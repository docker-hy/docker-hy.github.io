<div class="exercise" markdown="1">

  <h1>1.6</h1>

  Create a Dockerfile that starts with `FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise` and works only as a clock.

  The developer has poorly documented how the application works. Passing flags will open different functionalities, but
  we'd like to create a simplified version of it.

  Add a CMD line to the Dockerfile and tag it as "docker-clock" so that `docker run docker-clock` starts the application
  and the clock output.

  Return both Dockerfile(s) and the command you used to run the container(s)
