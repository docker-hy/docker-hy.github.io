  <h1>1.6</h1>

  Create a Dockerfile that starts with `FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise`.
  Add a CMD line to the Dockerfile.

  The developer has poorly documented how the application works. Nevertheless once you will execute an application (run a container from an image) you will have some clues on how it works.
  Your task is to run an application so that it will simulate a clock functionality.

  When you will build an image tag it as "docker-clock" so that `docker container run docker-clock` starts the application.

  Return both Dockerfile(s) and the command you used to run the container(s)
