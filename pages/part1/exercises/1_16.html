  Pushing to heroku happens in a same way. A project has already been prepared at `devopsdockeruh/heroku-example` so
  lets pull that first. Note that the image of the project is quite large.

  Go to [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/) and create a new app there and install heroku CLI. You can
  find additional instructions from `Deploy` tab under `Container Registry`.
  Tag the pulled image as `registry.heroku.com/_app_/_process-type_`, process-type can be `web` for this exercise.
  The app should be your project name in heroku.

  Then push the image to heroku with `docker push registry.heroku.com/_app_/web` and release it using the heroku CLI:
  `heroku container:release web` (you might need to login first: `heroku container:login`)

  For this exercise return the url in which the released application is.

  You could also use the heroku CLI to build and push, but since we didn't want to build anything this time it was
  easier to just tag the image.
