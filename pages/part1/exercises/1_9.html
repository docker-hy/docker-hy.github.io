  <h1>1.9: Volumes</h1>

  In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

  Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` creates the a timestamp every two seconds to `/usr/src/app/text.log` when it's not given a command. Start the
  container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

  Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.
