  <h1>3.2 Building images inside of a container</h1>

  Watchtower uses volume to docker.sock socket to access Docker daemon of the host from the container. By leveraging this ourselves we can create our own simple build service.

  Create a project that downloads a repository from github, builds a Dockerfile located in the root and then publishes it into Docker Hub.

  You can use any programming language / technology for the project implementation. A simple bash script is viable

  Then create a Dockerfile for it so that it can be run inside a container.

  Make sure that it can build at least some of the example projects.
