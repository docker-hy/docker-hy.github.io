  <h1>3.2 A deployment pipeline to heroku</h1>

  Let's create our first deployment pipeline!

  For this exercise you can select which ever web application you already have containerized.

  If you don't have any web applications available you can use any one from this course and modify it. (Such as the course material itself)

  Let's use GitHub, Github Actions, and Heroku to deploy to heroku. You can also use other CI/CD tools instead of GitHub Actions.
  
  Submit a link to the repository with the config.
