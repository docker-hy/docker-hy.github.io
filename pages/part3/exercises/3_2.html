  <h1>3.2 A deployment pipeline to heroku</h1>

  Let's create our first deployment pipeline!

  For this exercise you can select which ever web application you already have containerized.

  If you don't have any web applications available you can use any one from this course and modify it. (Such as the
  course material itself)

  Let's use GitHub, CircleCI, and Heroku to deploy to heroku. You can also use GitHub actions instead of CircleCI.

  CircleCI offers orbs for Heroku deployment, but you can just use the instructions from Heroku (or exercise 1.16).
