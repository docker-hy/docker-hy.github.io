  Add redis to example backend.

  Redis is used to speed up some operations. Backend uses a slow api to get information. You can test the slow api by
  requesting `/ping?redis=true` with curl. The frontend program has a button to test this.

  Configure a redis container to cache information for the backend. Use the documentation if needed when configuring:
  [https://hub.docker.com/\_/redis/](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)

  The backend [README](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend) should have all the information needed to
  connect.

  When you've correctly configured the button will turn green.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml

  > `restart: unless-stopped` can help if the redis takes a while to get ready
