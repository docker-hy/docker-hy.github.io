  <h1>2.7</h1>

  Configure a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) project.

  Look into machine learning project created with Python and React and split into three parts:
  [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/ml-kurkkumopo-frontend),
  [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/ml-kurkkumopo-backend) and
  [training](https://github.com/docker-hy/ml-kurkkumopo-training)

  Note that the training requires 2 volumes and backend should share volume `/src/model` with training.

  The frontend will display on http://localhost:3000 and the application will tell if the subject of an image looks more
  like a cucumber or a moped.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml

  > This exercise is known to have broken for some attendees based on CPU. The error looks something like "Illegal instruction (core dumped)". Try downgrading / upgrading the tensorflow found in requirements.txt or join the telegram channel and message with @jakousa.

  > Note that the generated model is a toy and will not produce good results.

  > It will take SEVERAL minutes to build the docker images, download training pictures and train the classifying
  model.
