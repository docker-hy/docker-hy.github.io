  <h1>2.6</h1>

  Add database to example backend.

  Lets use a postgres database to save messages. We won't need to configure a volume since the official postgres image
  sets a default volume for us. Lets use the postgres image documentation to our advantage when configuring:
  [https://hub.docker.com/\_/postgres/](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/). Especially part Environment Variables is of
  interest.

  The backend [README](https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker) should have all the information needed to
  connect.

  The button won't turn green but you can send messages to yourself.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml

  > TIP: When configuring the database, you might need to destroy the automatically created volumes. Use command `docker
  volume prune`, `docker volume ls` and `docker volume rm` to remove unused volumes when testing. Make sure to remove
  containers that depend on them beforehand.

  > `restart: unless-stopped` can help if the postgres takes a while to get ready
