  Read about how to add command to docker-compose.yml from the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#command).

  The familiar image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` can be used to start a web service.

  Create a docker-compose.yml and use it to start the service so that you can use it with your browser.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running `docker-compose up`
