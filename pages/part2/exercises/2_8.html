  <h1>2.8</h1>

  Add [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) to example frontend + backend.

  Accessing your service from arbitrary port is counter intuitive since browsers use 80 (http) and 443 (https) by
  default. And having the service refer to two origins in a case where there's only one backend isn't desirable either. We will skip the SSL setup for https/443.

  Nginx will function as a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) for us (see the image above).
  The requests arriving at anything other than /api will be redirected to frontend container and /api will get
  redirected to backend container. 

  At the end you should see that the frontend is accessible simply by going to http://localhost and the button works.
  Other buttons may have stopped working, do not worry about them.

  As we will not start configuring reverse proxies on this course you can have a simple config file:

  The following file should be set to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf inside the nginx container. You can use a file volume where
  the contents of the file are the following:

  ```
  events { worker_connections 1024; }

  http {
    server {
      listen 80;

      location / {
        proxy_pass _frontend-connection-url_;
      }

      location /api/ {
        proxy_pass _backend-connection-url_;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Nginx, backend and frontend should be connected in the same network. See the image above for how the services are connected.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml

  > Tips for making sure the backend connection works:

  > Try using your browser to access http://localhost/api/ping and see if it answers pong

  > It might be nginx configuration problem: Add trailing `/` to the backend url in the nginx.conf.
