  <h1>2.4</h1>
  
A project over at [https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise) has a hardly working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running `docker-compose up`.

Application should be accessible through [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). However it doesn't work well enough and I've added a load balancer for scaling. Your task is to scale the `compute` containers so that the button in the application turns green.
