  <h1>2.1</h1>

  *Exercises in part 2 should be done using docker-compose*

  Without a command `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` will create logs into its `/usr/src/app/text.log`.

  Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` and saves the logs into your
  filesystem.

  Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running `docker-compose up` if the log file exists.
