  Postgres image uses a volume by default. Manually define volumes for the database in convenient location such as in
  `./database` . Use the image documentations (postgres) to help you with the task. You may do the same for redis as
  well.

  After you have configured the volume:

  * Save a few messages through the frontend
  * Run `docker-compose down`
  * Run `docker-compose up` and see that the messages are available after refreshing browser
  * Run `docker-compose down` and delete the volume folder manually
  * Run `docker-compose up` and the data should be gone

  Maybe it would be simpler to back them up now that you know where they are.

  > TIP: To save you the trouble of testing all of those steps, just look into the folder before trying the steps. If
  it's empty after docker-compose up then something is wrong.

  > TIP: Since you may have broken the buttons in nginx exercise you should test with docker-compose.yml from before it

  Submit the docker-compose.yml
