title: 'Using a non-root user'
---

Let's get back to the yt-dlp application, that we for last time worked with it [Part 2](http://localhost:8000/part-2/1-migrating-to-docker-compose#volumes-in-docker-compose).

The application could, in theory, escape the container due to a bug in Docker or Linux kernel. To mitigate this security issue we will add a non-root user to our container and run our process with that user. Another option would be to map the root user to a high, non-existing user id on the host with https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/, and can be used in case you must use root within the container.

The Dockerfile that we did in [Part 1](/part-1/section-4) was this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

WORKDIR /mydir

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl python3
RUN curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
RUN chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp"]
```

We will add a user called _appuser_ with the following command

```dockerfile
RUN useradd -m appuser
```

After that we change the user with the directive [USER](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) - so all commands after this line will be executed as our new user, including the `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

WORKDIR /mydir

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl python3
RUN curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
RUN chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

RUN useradd -m appuser
USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp"]
```

The `WORKDIR` is renamed to /usr/videos since it makes more sense as the videos will be downloaded there. When we run this image without bind mounting our local directory:

```console
$ docker  run yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsqlHHTGQrw

... 

[info] XsqlHHTGQrw: Downloading 1 format(s): 22
[download] Unable to open file: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'Master’s Programme in Computer Science ｜ University of Helsinki [XsqlHHTGQrw].mp4.part'. Retrying (1/3)...

ERROR: unable to open for writing: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'Master’s Programme in Computer Science ｜ University of Helsinki [XsqlHHTGQrw].mp4.part'
```

We'll see that our `appuser` user has no access to write to the container filesystem. This can be fixed with `chown` or not fix it at all, if the intented usage is to always have a `/mydir` mounted from the host. By mounting the directory the application works as intended.

If we want to give the `appuser` permission to write inside the container, the permission change must be done when we are still executing as root, that is, before the directive `USER` is used to change the user:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# ...

WORKDIR /mydir

# create the appuser
RUN useradd -m appuser

# change the owner of current dir to appuser
RUN chown appuser .

# now we can change the user
USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp"]
```

## Exercise 3.5

:::caution Mandatory Exercise 3.5

  In exercises [1.12](/part-1/section-6#exercises-111-114) and [1.13](/part-1/section-6#exercises-111-114) we created Dockerfiles for both [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend).

  Security issues with the user being a root are serious for the example frontend and backend as the containers for web services are supposed to be accessible through the Internet.

  Make sure the containers start their processes as non-root user.

  The backend image is based on [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), which does not support the command `useradd`. Google will surely help you a way to create a user in an `alpine` based image.

  Submit the Dockerfiles.
