title: 'Multi-host environments'
---

Now that we've mastered containers in small systems with Docker Compose it's time to look beyond what the tools we practiced are capable of. In situations where we have more than a single host machine we cannot rely solely on Docker. However, Docker does contain other tools to help us with automatic deployment, scaling and management of dockerized applications.

In the scope of this course, we cannot go into how to use the tools in this section, but leaving them without a mention would be a disservice.

**Docker swarm mode** is built into Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single virtual host. You can read the feature highlights [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/). You can run right away with `docker swarm`. Docker swarm mode is the lightest way of utilizing multiple hosts.

**Kubernetes** is commonly default way of orchestrating your containers in large multi-host environments. The reason being it's customizability, large community and robust features. However the drawback is the higher learning curve compared to Docker swarm mode. You can read their introduction [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/). Other similar technologies exist, for example Apache Mesos and HashiCorp Nomad.

It is always good to remember that a single tool is rarely an optimal solution for all the possible scenarios. In a 2-3 host environment for a hobby project the gains from Kubernetes might not be as large compared to a environment where you need to orchestrate hundreds of hosts with multiple containers each.

You can get to know Kubernetes with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) a lightweight Kubernetes distribution which you can run inside containers with [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d). This is a great way to get started as you don't have to worry about complicated setup or any credit limits that the cloud providers alvays have.

Rather than maintaining one yourself the most common way to use Kubernetes is by using a managed service by a cloud provider. Such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) which are both offering some credits to get started.

## Exercise 3.11

:::info Exercise 3.11: Kubernetes

  Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes terminology and draw a diagram describing what "parts" the Kubernetes contains and how those are related to each other.

  You should draw a diagram of at least three host machines in a Kubernetes cluster. In the diagram assume that the cluster is running two applications. The applications can be anything you want. An example could be a videogame server and a blog website.

  You may take inspiration from the diagrams of [part 2](/part-2).

  The applications may utilize other machines or APIs that are not part of the cluster. At least three of the machines should be utilized. Include "your own computer" in the diagram as the one sending instructions via kubectl to deploy an application. In addition include a HTTP message coming from the internet to your Kubernetes cluster and how it may reach an application.

  Make sure to label the diagram so that anyone else who has completed this exercise, and read the glossary, would understand it. The diagram should contain at least four of the following labels: Pod, Cluster, Container, Service and a Volume.

  [Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true). And some [helpful diagrams](https://medium.com/@tsuyoshiushio/kubernetes-in-three-diagrams-6aba8432541c)

  I prefer to use [draw.io](https://draw.io) but you can use whichever tool you want.
